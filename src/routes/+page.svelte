<h1>
    I study how computing professionals develop the power and agency to create
    positive change, from their classroom experiences to professional practice.

<p>
    Advised by my amazing collaborators, Barbara Ericson and Mark Guzdial, I currently
    publish work in Computing Education and Human-Computer Interaction communities.
